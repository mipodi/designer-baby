                This is a website meant to imitate a gene-editing company that
                specialises in babies. It lets you try what it could be like to
                order a baby with technology that is likely to be available
                soon. Sometimes it's better to try something before reading
                about it. If you haven't,
                <a href="index.html#section-sex">go do it</a> and then come
                back.

              <p>
                The Designer Baby Project is an exploratory adventure by science
                journalist and writer
                <a href="http://www.kornfeldt.com/">Torill Kornfeldt</a> and web
                developer Julia Johansson of the visualization studio
                <a href="https://orderorder.io/">Order Order</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                When Torill was working on her second book The Unnatural
                Selection of Our Species she performed numerous interviews and
                research trips around the world to find out more on genetic
                editing in humans. In the beginning, she had a hypothesis that
                science was advanced but not within practical reach for decades.
              </p>
              <p>
                After one particular trip, she and Julia met for a cup of tea
                and Torill explained both horrified and excited that actually
                the first genetically modified babies had already been born.
                This and further development raised severe ethical issues. Why
                is no one talking about this? We need to talk about it!
              </p>
              <p>
                We then decided to take this knowledge and place it in the
                concrete format of a website where you can go through the
                process of ordering a customised baby. Because let's face it,
                society and people have a much greater chance of handling big
                changes if we have reflected upon them beforehand.
              </p>

              <p>
                All of the choices are probable and around the corner soon to be
                accessible. As with many new and shiny things, access is likely
                to be for only the very rich in the beginning. Even so, the
                entire field opens up questions such as "Who should be able to
                decide?" and "What should you be able to modify". When the
                opportunities exist, a passive choice will also be a choice.
              </p>

                That is still a big question, but these two articles give some
