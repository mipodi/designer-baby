                Would you like to genetically modify your child? Who should be
                allowed to make the decision, health care workers, parents or

              </p>
              <p>
                We might not be able to design our babies just yet, but the
                possibility is fast approaching. The first genetically modified
                babies were born in November 2018. They were modified by the
                researcher He Jiankui who was later convicted by the Chinese
                government due to the illegal nature of the experiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the investigation that followed it was revealed that He
                Jiankui had planned to open a genetic clinic for “elite
                customers”. Different fertility clinics around the globe are
                also offering an array of genetic tests and treatments,
                sometimes under very limited legal scrutiny.
              </p>
              <p>
                But this is also a technology that might help eliminate some
                diseases and to ease the suffering of families with genetic
                disorders or fertility issues. For better or worse, gene editing
                is poised to change ourselves and our future children. It is a
                future we should start thinking about as soon as possible.
