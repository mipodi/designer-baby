## About

This web application is meant to imitate a gene-editing company that
specialises in babies. It lets you try what it could be like to order a baby
with technology that is likely to be available soon.

The Designer Baby Project is an exploratory endeavour by science journalist and
writer Torill Kornfeldt and web developer Julia Johansson of the visualization
studio Order Order.

## Stack

The Designer Baby Project application is coded in HTML and CSS with the
help of SASS, Prettier and then deployed on Netlify. No JavaScript
framework was harmed in the process. Jokes aside, I wanted to see the
limitations of HTML and CSS anno 2021 and not fall back to creating a div with
JavaScript all the time. With this project I set myself up for using native
elements as much as possible as well as animation with CSS. The only JavaScript
is in the analytics script. I did get some problems with Netlify and the build
process. Eventually I solved it by having copies in the www folder and when I
minify the css and html to there and pushes, it goes live.
